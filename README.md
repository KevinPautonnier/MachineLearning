# MachineLearning

Repo of my exercices of Machine Learning for the Ynov courses

## cours1.py

Use of panda and matplotlib to show how the gold difference impact the winner team in League of Legend

## cours2.py

Use of gradient descent on the cost function to minimize the error of our hypothesis.

I use three random points and matplotlib to show the result

## cours3.py

Comparison of handwritten digits from sklearn with the Logistic Regression

I use the One vs One comparison to estimate one digit.

## cours4.1.py

The derivative of e^(x) = e^(x) 
We search to estimate e with a^(x) = a^(x) * ln(a) if ln(a) where ln(a) approach to 1

## cours4.2.py

We search to estimate e with the taylor sequence

## cours5.1.py

I train a model using surprise to predict what rating a user can give to a film

the graph show the deltas between the prediction and the real rate

## cours5.2.py
